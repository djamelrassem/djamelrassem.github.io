I am a PhD student in computer science at Universit√© Grenoble Alpes in the [GHOST team](https://ghost-team.gitlabpages.inria.fr/members/), I work on stochastic approximation theory and online learning supervised by [Nicolas Gast](https://polaris.imag.fr/nicolas.gast/) and [Dorian Baudry](https://dbaudry.github.io/).
